1. PURPOSE & OVERVIEW
DailyStandUp (DSU) is a place for student dev's to collaborate in real time, on real projects, in a setting that is as close to a professional environment as possible. 
This means using industry best practices such as git and trello, testing and CI. It also means working with a team in real time over a video conferencing system, performing stand ups in your team, being available by video , audio and chat during designated work times and participating with enthusiasm and professonalism in the project. 

DSU also provides a private work environment and a safe learning environment. The app is not public facing in any way. Write access is restricted to participants.

Final projects are submitted for review on deadline day, and reviewed by staff. 

DSU is intended for intermediate to advanced devs, and to that end features an entrance exam which has to be passed in order to gain access to the app.

It is important for the app to provide a safe learning environment, so there are considerations of conduct and also of privacy. We want teams to be able to take on challenges and maybe  fail, and not face scrutiny or shaming of any kind. 

DSU features assesment tests in particular tech areas. These are 
PENDING CONCEPTS...
- rankings.
- assesment
- Code of conduct
- like a pickup game, users can join any team with availability
- how do we deal with problems of team dynamics? We don't. Either a project gets submitted or it doesn't, and then it either passes review or it doesn't. We offer the platform and don't micro-manage the team.

The assesments, together with peer reviews and other metrics are used to form a user ranking or score. This is an ongoing marker of progress and can be used to gamify and motivate the user. Some metrics will be made public within the app, others will be kept private...

 3. RANDOM NOTES
 - What goes on in a team, how they run themselves, deal with problems etc, is outside our scope. 
 - A library of documentation and resources guides users through the steps.
 - I see this integrating with FreeCodeCamp.org and making use of their platform for a lot of the functionality (login, registration etc)
 - Our goal is to prototype a stand alone version to demo to the dev team at FCC
